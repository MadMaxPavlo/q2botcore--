q2botcore++

Here lies the remnants of an old port of Ben Scharzinger's Q2BotCore to Linux and Mac.

Aside from the OS port there has been some work at parsing the gamestate into a C++
object model. The intent was that this object model would be used as the environment
in which genetically programmed bots would evolve within.

I lost the change history in a borked SVN repo.

Still compiles!
